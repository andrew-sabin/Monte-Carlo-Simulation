# Monte-Carlo-Simulation

Based on this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kVH8Wh7tBo) the projects aim to simulate how many golfballs going down hill will potentially make it into the hole. 

Project 1 uses OpenMP in order to do multithreaded parallelism on different cores with a processor.

Project 5 uses CUDA Cores in order to do parallelism on different cores with a graphics card or graphics card server.

## Project 1- OpenMP Monte Carlo Simulation


## Project 5- CUDA Core Monte Carlo Simulation
